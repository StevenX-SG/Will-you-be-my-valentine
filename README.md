# Will You Be My Valentine?

To the singles who come here for hopes, I will have to extinguish that hope right there.

It's not that you have no hope but rather the opposite gender have too high expectations.

I myself have yet to find one despite creating this.

It was inspired by @hohjiada on Instagram and built using https://github.com/saurabhnemade/will-you-be-my-valentine as a base."
